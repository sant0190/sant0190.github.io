I created my web portfolio mostly based off of the design that i have made in my ux design layout. I used bootstrap for some parts, and made use of grids, and flexbox for most of the layout to make my life much easier. I came across a lot of challenges such as grids not working or flexbox being unsuitable for the task, I read through my previous notes that I have made for html and css and found some solutions and google helped a lot. I have learned to use bootstrap and have a better understanding to javascript and grids.
